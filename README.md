#This is a code written to show the power of OpenCV!<br />
The code opens the webcam to capture the background and deletes the red colorspace and replaces it with the static background.<br />
This makes the foreground object or the colourspace to be invisible.<br />
Note- To make a different color invisible, just replace the values of the mask with lower and higher range of that colospace.
